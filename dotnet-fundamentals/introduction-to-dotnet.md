# Introduction to .NET, history, versions, uses.

.NET is a unified development platform that allows the construction of systems and applications.

## .NET history

Microsoft started working on C# in the late 90s, with its first version of the framework launched in 2022, aiming to compete with Java.

The concept of multiplatform was booming at the time, and the Microsoft worked on Java improvements and implementations on its platform, but was blocked by Sun.

This motivated Microsoft to develop an ecosystem integrated into Windows, making it easy to develop desktop and web applications, and that it was tied only to the Windows, thus increasing its relevance.

#### If 2016 was the last version of .NET, what happened in 2020 then?

.NET Core and .NET 5 are the same things, but they removed the Core because .NET is the original name. So, from .NET 5 onwards, it's jsut about .NET Core.
