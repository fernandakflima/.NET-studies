# Introduction to .NET, history, versions, uses.

.NET is a unified development platform that allows the construction of systems and applications.

## .NET history

Microsoft started working on C# in the late 90s, with its first version of the framework launched in 2022, aiming to compete with Java.

The concept of multiplatform was booming at the time, and the Microsoft worked on Java improvements and implementations on its platform, but was blocked by Sun.

This motivated Microsoft to develop an ecosystem integrated into Windows, making it easy to develop desktop and web applications, and that it was tied only to the Windows, thus increasing its relevance.

## .NET evolution

| Year | Event (.NET Framework)   |
|------|--------------------------|
| 1998 | .NET development started |
| 2002 | .NET 1.0 and C# 1.0      |
| 2005 | .NET 2.0 and C# 2.0      |
| 2006 | .NET 3.0                 |
| 2007 | .NET 3.5 and C# 3.0      |
| 2010 | .NET 4.0 and C# 4.0      |

| Year | Event (.NET Core)             |
|------|-------------------------------|
| 2012 | C# 5.0 and .NET 4.5           |
| 2014 | .NET Foundation               |
| 2015 | C# 6.0 and .NET 4.6           |
| 2016 | .NET Core 1.0 - multiplatform |
| 2016 | .NET Standard 1.0             |
| 2016 | C# 7.0 and .NET 4.7           |
| 2019 | .NET 4.8 - final version      |
| 2020 | .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5      |

#### If 2016 was the last version of .NET, what happened in 2020 then?

.NET Core and .NET 5 are the same things, but they removed the Core because .NET is the original name. So, from .NET 5 onwards, it's jsut about .NET Core.

# Differences between .NET Framework (Legacy) and .NET

.NET Framework: Fully - featured and integrated .NEt libraries and runtime fo Windows

.NET: CoreCLR - Modular and optimized .NET libraries and runtimes

# .NET compiler and its working

## What is a compiler?
### High-level language

The language that we understand and write our source code.

### Low-level-language

The language that the machine he understands. It has little abstraction, making it difficult to understand.

### Compiler

It is a program that performs the conversion of high-level to low-level language.

# Compiler and Transpiler
## Compiler
It is a program that performs the conversion of high-level to low-level language.

### Transpiler
It is the conversion of a language or implementation to another. Your exit remains in high-level language.

# Not all languages are compiled
## Compiled language

These are languages in which the source code is translated into machine code.

## Interpreted language
These are languages that make reading and interpretation directly from the source code.
